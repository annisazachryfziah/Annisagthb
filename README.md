I am a 3rd-year student in the software engineering technology study program at Indorama engineering polytechnic.

I'm currently passionate about the world of front-end, such as learning about the Web, Android, Desktop, and others. because of my hope, I want to master this field to the best of my ability so that it will be more useful for the future.

S.Tr. Kom is coming! In Syaa Allah
